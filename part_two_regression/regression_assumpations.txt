In order to build the linear model we have to check if the data follows below Assumption

    1) Linearity
    2) Homoscedasticity
    3) Multivariate normality
    4) Independence of errors (No auto-correlation)
    5) Lack of multi-collinearity


building the regression model

1) backward elimination

    1) select the significance level (default Sl = 0.05)
    2) fit the model with all independent variable
    3) consider the variable with highest P-values if P > SL got to 4 else your model is ready.
    4) remove the variable
    5) fit the model again with this variable and go to step 4

2) forward selection

    1) select the significance level (default Sl = 0.05)
    2) fit all simple regression (i.e. one independent variable) models y ~ x^n select the one with lowest P-values
    3) keep this variable and add one variable and fit all the possible models
    4) consider the model with lowest P-values if P < SL repeat the step 3 otherwise
       your model is ready (use previous model).

3) Bi directional elimination (step wise regression)

    1) select the significance level to enter and to stay in the model (default SLENTER = 0.05. SLSTAY = 0.05)
    2) perform the next step of forward selection (new variable must have P < SLENTER to enter)
    3) perform the next step of forward elimination (new variable must have P < SLSTAY to stay)
    4) perform above two-step until a no new variable can enter or no old variable can exit
    5) model is ready

4) All Possible models

    1) select the criteria of goodness of fit (e.g. Akaike criterion)
    2) construct all possible regression model: 2^N-1 total combination (n is independent variable)
    3) select the one with best criterion
